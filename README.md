# 📊 DSA Visualizer

An **interactive tool** built with **Python** and **Pygame** to visualise **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It simplifies complex concepts like arrays, linked lists, stacks, heaps, and trees (BST, AVL, Red-Black) through **real-time animations** and a **retro pixel-art interface**.  

Perfect for **students, educators, and enthusiasts** who want to better understand how DSAs work.

## ✨ Features

- 🎥 **Interactive Visualizations**  
  Explore data structures such as:
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Heaps  
  - Trees: Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red-Black Tree  
  Watch operations like **insertion, deletion, balancing, and rotations** in action.

- ⚡ **Algorithm Visualizations**  
  - Searching: Linear Search, Binary Search  
  - Sorting: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort  

- 🎨 **Custom Pixel Art**  
  Unique retro-inspired **buttons, UI elements, and colour palettes** for an engaging experience.

- 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
  - **Python 3.x**  
  - **Pygame** (lightweight, cross-platform)

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Pygame → install with:
  ```bash
  pip install pygame
  ```

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd dsa-visualizer
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🕹️ Usage

1. Launch the app (`python main.py`) to open the **main menu**.  
2. Choose a **data structure** (e.g., Array, Linked List, Stack, Heap, BST, AVL, Red-Black Tree).  
3. Perform operations such as:
   - Add/remove elements  
   - Balance / rotate trees  
   - Run search or sort algorithms  
4. Watch **real-time animations** to see how the structure evolves.
