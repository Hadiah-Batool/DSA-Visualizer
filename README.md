DSA Visualizer
Overview
DSA Visualizer is an interactive tool built with Python and Pygame to visualize Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It simplifies complex concepts like arrays, linked lists, stacks, heaps, and trees (including Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, and Red-Black Trees) through real-time animations and a retro pixel-art interface. Ideal for students, educators, or anyone aiming to better understand DSA.
Features

Interactive Visualizations: Explore data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, heaps, and trees (BST, AVL, Red-Black) with animations for operations such as insertions, deletions, rotations, and more.
Algorithms: Visualize searching (e.g., linear, binary) and sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble, quicksort) in action.
Custom Pixel Art: Unique buttons, UI elements, and a retro-inspired color palette for an engaging user experience.
Tech Stack: Built with Python and Pygame for lightweight, accessible performance.

Installation

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Pygame (pip install pygame)


Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>


Navigate to the project directory: cd dsa-visualizer


Run the visualizer: python main.py



Usage

Launch the application to access the main menu.
Select a data structure (e.g., Array, Linked List, Stack, Heap, BST, AVL, Red-Black Tree) to visualise.
Perform operations like adding/removing nodes, balancing trees, or running search/sort algorithms.
Observe real-time animations to understand how the data structure or algorithm evolves.

Future Improvements

Expand data structure support (e.g., tries, graphs).
Enhance algorithm visualisations (e.g., pathfinding, advanced sorting).
Improve animation smoothness and add more interactive UI controls.
Introduce customizable themes and settings for a personalised experience.
